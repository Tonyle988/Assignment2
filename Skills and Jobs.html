           As a team we decided that the 4 positions needed to deliver the project outcomes would be: Lead developer, back-end developer, front-end developer and a project manager. The main skills we need for our chatbot project are proficient IT skills and leadership. Since our project idea is a chatbot designed for customer service on various online stores, a front-end and a back-end developer would be a great help to ensure the website and its servers work together to enable the chatbot to work smoothly. The lead developer would be the one to keep the back-end and front-end developers on track to accomplishing the projectâ€™s goal as he gives out technical direction and provides mentoring to the developers. The Project Manager will keep everyone in line and make sure work is going to be completed by its deadline, while also documenting constraints and progress.
