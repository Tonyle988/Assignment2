            Central Data Networks are hiring Graduate Software Developers for their company. There are so many job vacancies in seek.com.au, but most of them required 1 or 2 year working experience. But as a fresh graduate I have no working experience before that.<br><br>
            - They are seeking Bachelor's degree in Computer Science or equivalent person for this job.<br>
            - Need Web Development experience using Angular, jQuery, JavaScript and HTML5.<br>
            - Preferably with experience in software technologies and designs using C#, SQL and knowledge and understanding of the SDLC and development methodologies such as Agile.<br>
            - Strong passion for learning and career development. Excellent verbal & written English communication skills.<br>
            - Provide communication between the chief architect, project manager, key stakeholders and the project management team.<br><br>
            In my degree program I have did several assignments related to the web technologies like react, node backend, laravel backend. I gained some sort of industry type experience with clients who given me a small application to build their custom requirements. Requirement gathering was very difficult part to me. And limited time frame I did that project. It was heavy stress to me. I have learn some relation database (MySql) and non-relational database (MongoDB). These days I’m planning to some self-learning stuffs for get more knowledge about industrial related technologies and best practices

            I have always had an interest in the production of video games so to be able to take part in the development of a game has always been a dream of mine. The thing that appeals to me the most is that I will be able to collaborate with different teams and have a bit of control over what I want to create. <br><br>

            Proficient knowledge and skill of the programming language C++ alongside the ability to work independently on the job without too much supervision is greatly needed for this job. There is also the requirement of having prior game development experience in which one must have completed a major games project. <br><br>

            As of currently, I have not gotten the skills, qualifications or experience that can contribute to me applying for the position. As a starting point, I can begin learning C++ through an online course and gradually make some progress towards a small simple game. I guess building a strong foundation for programming in general is a necessity as it will help with completing the assigned tasks more efficiently and to decrease frustration. The job seems to require a great amount of experience with game designing which I can obtain by analyzing various games and taking notes.

            My Ideal Job would be as a Software Developer. It is a role that appeals to me as it requires a high level of work within a team but also autonomy at the same time; a Software developer must have autonomy and creativity to create what their team wants without help, but also the ability to work within said team to get the project done.<br><br>

Software Development positions are attractive to me because of the open ended nature of the job; most companies have junior and senior positions, so there is an opportunity to be promoted and given more responsibility. On top of this, the role is interesting to me because I love the creativity that comes with development and programming. Software development will require me to have extensive knowledge of Python, C, C# and C++, as well as SQL and JavaScript

            Ideally, I would pursue a gig as a full stack developer, I am curious to see how each element and layer in a system works to achieve the overriding goal. <br>
            Full stack development draws my attention as it requires specialist knowledge, innovative thinking and skills across many different IT (Information Technology) disciplines, particularly open-source intelligence. <br>
            Company culture really is the ultimate selling point for me, from my experience it is the most challenging thing for companies to get right.<br><br> 
 
            Most ‘full stack’ positions require extensive knowledge for complete autonomy in end-to-end development across languages such as: <br>
            C# ASP .NET, HTML 5/CSS, TypeScript, Knockout, React, jQuery/JavaScript, SQL, WCF, Bootstrap. <br><br>
 
            In addition to the desired bachelor’s degree in computer science, I would need to spend a significant amount of time becoming proficient across the above mentioned languages.

            A Cyber Security Specialist is a job in which you focus on improving and maintaining the security and safety of data and information held by the company while noting any issues and dealing with them before they can happen. This includes internal and external threats to any cyber related issues such as phishing and hackings to loopholes in software or hardware.<br><br>

            To become a Cyber Security Specialist, I will need experience or qualifications to handle information security operations, Experience with SIEM tools such as Splunk, Tripwire, Devo, etc. I would also require experience with system and data administration and networking within enterprise environments, as well as experience dealing with incident handling and remediation, log analysis or forensics. To work at places like Deakin University I would also need a valid Working with Children permit.

        The recurring theme present across all team members career aspirations involves backend engineering. The desired career selections are quite broad ranging from Full stack / Software development, Cybersecurity, and Videogame design; All these disciplines require specialist knowledge, proficiency in various programming languages, high level communication, teamwork skills and the ability to problem solve autonomously. <br><br>

        Video game design could be considered the outlier of the group’s selections given it requires far higher creative design skills, required for high fidelity animation, as opposed to cybersecurity which requires abstract mathematical thinking and high-level problem solving. Whilst cybersecurity is centered around keeping unwanted users out of a system, full stack / software development is about designing and building user centered applications to attract and serve target market demographics. <br><br>

        Both video game design and cybersecurity require intense mathematical knowledge; Videogames utilize physics equations and algorithms to simulate real-world dynamics in gameplay, whilst cybersecurity requires heavy encryption algorithms to keep systems secure. Software development requires high level understanding of end-to-end object orientated programming and databasing to create functional programs to fulfill users’ requirements. <br><br>
