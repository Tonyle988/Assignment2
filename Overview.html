            <b>Topic </b><br><br>
            Our Project Idea is a Chatbot that can be used as a FAQ for a shopping website, that allows the users to ask questions and check on status of orders or suggest products based on specifications or tell new or upcoming products that may be released and help guide users to these pages. The Chatbot would have voice recognition commands such as “I would like to check my order” in which the bot would respond with information, asking for further specification if necessary. The Chatbot would be able to do multiple things like checking orders, recommend products based on suggestions given by an algorithm such as if you like items marked with a tag such as ‘gaming’ it could recommend other items  

            The bot would be created in Python and will draw information that is compiled in a database (SQL) to give information on various products to the user. The bot will also answer light talk. The information given will depend on the question asked, such as do you have stock of XXX, which will give you an answer of if the store has it or what is the price of XX to which it will answer.

            <b>Motivation </b><br><br>
            
            The Motivation stems from a personal interest in chatbots and how they work, as well as the broad amount of uses they can have stemming from assistants to customer support. There also seems to be a large opportunity for such chatbot as websites such as Target and EB-Games don’t have such technology. This would help users navigate such websites, get quick access to their orders, and would make use of the websites more efficiently which could promote people using it. Chatbots are a current trend in the IT industry and will likely stick around for a long time, this is due to the fact that it is less expensive to run a chatbot on a website than to have service desk employees on call 24/7 as it is able to answer a large number of queries made by consumers by itself, leaving more important queries that the bot can't solve to humans which will result in better customer service for everyone.

            <b>Landscape </b><br><br>
          
            The Chatbot Landscape, is one that is very full, since it's so helpful in the everyday life of any business, however these bots, created by companies such as Chatbot.com, Tidio, etc., are generally Chatbots which focus on answering FAQs, Our Chatbot will hopefully be able to go further than most normal chatbots and will allow the user to get more information than normal with ease, allowing them to get information on specific items without finding them through searching or going to the cart only to find out stock is sold out, and will recommend items based on ratings.
