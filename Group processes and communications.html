           Our group will communicate through 2 mediums, one is Discord, where we have quick access to each other and can message each other to get a response in a small amount of time, the other medium is Microsoft Teams where we will host our meetings, Meetings will generally take place once a week for 30 – 60 minutes which allows everyone to tell each other on what they are doing, where they are up to and if they need help, We can also hold more meetings if necessary. If a group member doesn’t respond we will have to do their work while constantly trying to get their attention, if they don’t show up to meetings they can be caught up through messages, but contact can be constantly done through discord messaging.
