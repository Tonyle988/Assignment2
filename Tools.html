            To set up the group repo, We created a normal repository similar to what was done in the last assignment, then I went into the setting and invited each member of our group by their account’s email, they then needed to accept the invitation which was sent into their emails. After the CSS and page layout was completed, I created the pages by going to settings, enabling GitHub Pages, after that I made it so that it grabs the html from the main folder, which let it display the created CSS on the page. 
        </p>
        <p>
        I believe the Github audit trail to be inaccurate in reflecting our groups work. The Github audit trail tracks the creation of this website overall, but does not track the creation of the documents and information that make up this website as they are being stored in the MSTeams "Files" system. <br><br> This means that while the documents' information are included in this website, the creation of this information is not tracked by the Github audit trail, the only thing that is tracked is when the information is added to the website. Therefore the work of the group is not well reflected on the Github audit trail.
