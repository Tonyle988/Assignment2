            The Project itself is a Chatbot for a shopping website such as Target and EB-Games. The Chatbot would include a FAQ section where users can ask the bot how to do various things such as check on their order’s status or get recommended products under specifications such as recent releases or product type or information.
            
            Project has begun with deep understanding of the websites and the services that provide by them to customers to retain. Since “customer support” is playing crucial role in strengthen of relationship between the owner and the customer, effective and efficiency customer service is required by customers. Chatbot is the best solution to guide and fulfill their expectation in a proper way by running 24x7. This means that customers can use chatbot at any time anywhere, even outside of the normal working hours and they don’t wait for a specific time to get the information that they want.
            
            We have decided to build an application using Natural Language Processing(NLP) platform which has the ability to turn text and speech into understandable data for the machine by splitting words into smaller parts based on meaning or checking words for typos and correcting them. Though Rule-based bots are at this point the quicker, cheaper and more effective solution, NLP has been chosen as it has the ability to understand the context even when questions are more complex. 
            
            Further, we have studied and implemented Natural Language Understanding(NLU) for the purpose of understanding the meaning of the user’s input. NLU is recognizing patterns in human speech, further categorized by Dictionary, determining meaning of words, Parser, to determine if the syntax conforms to the rules of language, and Grammar Rules, to break down the input based on sentence structure and punctuation.
            
            In our implementation of application, we focused on knowledge base which is a library of information that the chatbot relies on to fetch the data used to respond to users. Here, we have implemented a system to provide information products and prices.
            
            This Chatbot application requires data input which can be either text or speech, asked by users to be interpreted or stored for usage and analysis. Our system extracts the information from input and then perform NLU and prepare the answer which sends back to user. Further, this application needs to store this extracted information into a database for future use. We have chosen MongoDB as a database to store data and retrieve information to show based on customer’s query.
            
            Other main concept that we did is Natural Language Generation(NLG). NLG is a software that produces understandable text in human languages. This process is being carried out by 7 major step including Content determination, Discourse planning, Sentence aggregation, Lexicalization, Referring expression generation, Syntactic and morphological realization and Orthographic realization.
            
            Our product is based in the cloud and are generally provided by services providers similar to internet service providers. We have implemented this system using Python3 which is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. The prime reason for choosing Python is that it reduces the margin of errors for beginners and professionals and easy to define strategic roadmaps to take under different scenarios. Python has extensive libraries including artificial intelligence, data science & machine learning processes. While developing chatbot, Python makes use of a combination of Machine Learning algorithms in order to build a different types of responses.  Those features helped us to develop our system to communicate with customers and provide relevant and appropriate replies to them.
            
            Currently, there are multiple natural language processing services which are provided on the internet. We have decided to use Google’s Api.ai to implement a system because it is providing Google Cloud's AI tools. Their APIs can handle things like speech recognition, intent recognition and context management, and allows devs to provide domain-specific knowledge. Since this Api.ai supports 15 languages including English, Chinese, French, German & Spanish, in future it helps us to expand our product to support multi languages from different countries. 
            
            Our system has designed to draw information from database such as Item names, Item Tags, Prices and other features that allow it to provide what the customer needs. We have identified that MongoDB is the best database solution to provide required information to customers. MongoDB is a powerful new database which is really easy to iterate and store non-relational databases. It requires no more SQL queries and ALTER tables to add extra data. 
            
            Since, chatbot is generally run through servers that are online 24x7, we use AWS severs to run our application continuously which helps our customer to get access to the data at any time with ease.
            
            Even though chatbot has come up with few drawback like costly to setup and automate a lengthy or complex process than train human staff, some older generation would prefer to talk to a real person and don’t have enough knowledge to interact with chatbot and emotionless, it has wide range of advantages to customers as well as product owner like time & money saving by reduction of staff in business and extra training for new employees, data recollection from database since it is connected to database.
            
            Our system is designed to handle multiple requests when business deals with high volume of users on daily basis. This allows to connect quickly with multiple customers in a very short time to interact with them and provide relevant information.
              
            This system gives high priority to customer’s satisfaction by providing accurate and satisfactory response. This helps us to enhance the business and retain existing customers.
            
            When our project deals with huge amount of Data and information, we can easily get to know what information that customer is looking for in real time. This process can be done because of storing all the data to MongoDB and it has the facility to analyze those data using external tools.
            
            Before we start to design the system, we all have agreed to develop simple and attractive user interface. While developing is going on, we have added few elements such as series of graphical and language elements that allow for human-computer interaction. Our conversational user interfaces are software that mimics a conversation with a real person via text or voice.
            
            This system has another interesting feature which is user-friendly error messages. We have included Calls to Action(CTA) in our chatbot error messages which is one of the most successful strategies. This will really help us to guide our customers by suggesting them or enter most specific information to assist them. Further, we strictly avoid to produce same error message repeatedly. Instead of that, we write a same error message in multiple variations.
            
            Finally, we have enabled the facility to provide a feedback by users at the end of the conversation. This will help us to improve our chatbot. Apart from using those feedbacks for improvement, we will make them loyal to your brand by showing them that their ideas and opinion are important for us.
