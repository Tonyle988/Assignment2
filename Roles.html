           One of the specific roles that we have defined is ‘lead developer’ which is given to James as he is much more knowledgeable about chatterbots compared to everyone else. Although everyone is aware of the direction that the chatterbot is going in, James knows best about the technology required, and the steps needed to develop a prototype for the chatterbot. Another role that we’ve defined that is given to Matthew is ‘website developer’ because he is the one who sets up the website, maintains it and uploads any work we’ve done that needs to be on the page. Aside from those two, there are no other roles as we just complete the work assigned to us, but we are free to work on any aspect of the website, which includes the website and the prototype. Although most of us know HTML, CSS or python well, it is better to have one that leads the development as having too many people doing one thing can get hectic.
