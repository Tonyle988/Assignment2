            The General Skills required for all of our ideal jobs are fairly simple; things that you could potentially use every day in any job, not just specific to the IT industry. The list of general skills required for our jobs are: Creativity, Problem Solving, Communication Skills, Troubleshooting, Writing, and Team Work.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Specific Skills required for all of our ideal jobs are more complex; skills that are only used in the IT industry, and are specific to the task at hand.

            The specific skills required for our jobs rank quite highly in terms of the Burning Glass data given to us. Most of the skills identified in the job listings are referenced within the data as high demand skills. The highest skill in the data that we identified as required for our ideal jobs is SQL, which as a database management solution makes sense. other highly ranked skills are JavaScript, C#, HTML5 and jQuery. Other notable skills featured in the Burning glass data are: Git, Python and Angular.
        </p>
        <p>
            The general skills required for our jobs also rank quite highly in terms of the Burning glass data given to us. All of the identified general skills are referenced in the Burning Glass data. The highest ranked skill that we recognised was Communication Skills, which makes sense as almost every job in IT requires you to work in a team or at least with clients and managers etc. Other highly ranked skills are Problem Solving, Writing, Troubleshooting and Teamwork. The lowest skill featured in the data was Creativity.

            The top 3 specific skills that we did not identify are: Microsoft Windows, JAVA, and LINUX. these were oversights by us as upon consideration we think that it would be expected for us to interact with both Windows and Linux Environments.
        </p>
        <p>
            The top 3 general skills that we did not identify are: Organisational skills, Planning, and Detail-Oriented. These skills are in High demand and are oversights by us as we recognise that most employers would expect us to be able to use these skills in everyday work

            Having looked at the Burning Glass data, our opinion on our Ideal Jobs did not change. this is because as a group we all chose jobs in areas of IT that we are passionate about as opposed to what is paying the most or what is in demand. While we recognise that demand (and as a result salary) is an incredibly relevant factor when choosing our Ideal Jobs, we also place motivation and entertainment at our workplace higher than paycheck when choosing Ideal Jobs.
