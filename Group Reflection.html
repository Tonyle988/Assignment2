                The group worked ok throughout the assignment 3 period, we had trouble with communication especially at the beginning of the assignment. Though once we started making contact the assignment progressed quite quickly.  Our group got all the report content done in a reasonable timeframe, and we all worked well with each other and there were no arguments or conflicts. In terms of what didn’t go so well, the project itself was left essentially to the last minute and there were a few issues with the programming of the chatbot itself which lead to quite a few issues with the project itself, Our communication as a group was also quite limited and people didn’t get to meetings on time with some meetings not happening at all, which hindered the progress of the project, one thing that was surprising was the difficulty of getting the project started and splitting the work among the members in our group. In terms of groups, I learnt how difficult it is to organise meetings and work to be allocated without meeting in person at all.

                Once again, we had a rough start as not everyone could attend the group meetings and there were some communication issues throughout the assignment duration. When we managed to have a meeting with everyone, work was assigned, and we progressed at a decent pace. I think the thing that went well was the allocation of work for the group as this gave us a clear idea of what to work on until the next meeting. One thing that could have been done better was our communication as that would have been helpful in knowing where everyone is currently at with their work, and it would also help in arranging meetings where everyone was present. I also wish that work was done at a consistent pace to avoid leaving the report until the last minute to complete, which ended up happening. I was surprised at how knowledgeable my team members are about debugging in python and programming in general. I also learnt that everyone in a group has their specialties/roles when it comes to an assignment which helps with the flow of work.

                The group worked well in assignment 3, In the beginning of the assignment we had difficulties in communication with each other. But we overcame them and made satisfactory progress throughout the assignment. After our first meeting for assignment 3, work was assigned between members of the group and allocated a time frame for them as well. Everyone finished their assigned task within that period by communicating with each other and helping by each other. The best thing went well for us was the allocation of work on first meeting. As for my opinion  if we improve our communication we could have done better on this assignment. 

                Furthermore, I was really happy about the skills of my group members. The Python skills of James and Michael was so brilliant and designing skill of Tony as well. Mathew show his skill with HTML by helping me with the setup of Github.

               The group once again pulled together and worked cohesively to achieve a final working prototype and report to satisfy our requirements at this stage of the development process. Once again team meetings were facilitated well and efficiently with a structured agenda, Group members agreed early on to work allocations which we all deemed fair. Group members finished all work in a timely manner to a high standard. Note: there is compatibility issues with prototype application, requires python version 3, with modules chatterbot and tkinter installed. Hopefully a module patch will be released soon.
