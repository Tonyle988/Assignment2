           As Identified above, the purpose of this chatbot application is to inform the user of helpful information relating to their browsing / purchasing experience. As well intending as the app is, the company has a responsibility to provide the user with correct information in relation to buying decisions, given that the final version of the bot will be fully AI autonomous, we run the risk of the chatbot providing incorrect information to the user in relation to a purchase, this may come at the cost of the company utilizing our service, who may then decide to bill our team. Technical errors and interactions with areas of the client website are possible, if we are not careful API interactions could change key site information such as pricing or shipping options, this would also present a financial risk to the company and software vendor.
