            My name is Matthew Shanahan, but normally I go by Matt. I am studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. Ever since I was young, I have had a passion for video games and slowly that evolved into a passion for everything IT. During high school I taught myself python and HTML as hobbies because that’s just what I was interested in at the time. During my free time you can usually find me playing video games or trampolining, although I've recently picked up skating as well. In the future I hope to be able to work on software solutions in fields that interest me.

            My name is Michael McKeown, my interest in It was stoked from a young age, having built a PC in my early years, messing around with programming, gaming and fault finding. <br><br>
 
            I appreciate the concept of programming as there is an infinite number of possibilities, your skill and imagination are the only limit to what you can accomplish. <br><br>
             
            I enjoy long drives, loud music, and good coffee. <br><br>
             
            Automation is what draws me to study IT at RMIT, as someone who likes to find an easier way of doing things, what is easier than something that does itself?
