           We plan to test our project through lab-based user testing as we can give users tasks/scenarios and in turn we can observe and record valuable information regarding whether or not the chatterbot is a success or not. We would look at the time taken for users to complete the given tasks, whether they completed the task and any possible deviations. The given tasks will probably be like ‘Find purple winter wear’ which the users can ask the chatbot instead of going through the search bar or drop-down bars. There are several ways we can find users to test, one of which being through ‘usertesting.com’ and the other being through friends, relatives, and acquaintances. Our testing will need approximately 10 people of different ages with no need for any particular background. Usertesting.com is an easy way to test strangers so that the method is bias proof. The moment users take about the same time as our ideal time to complete the task and no bugs nor errors arise during the testing will be the moment, we consider our project to be a success.
